DESCRIPTION
-----------

IPTraf-ng is a console-based network monitoring program for Linux that
displays information about IP traffic.  It returns such information as:

	Current TCP connections
	UDP, ICMP, OSPF, and other types of IP packets
	Packet and byte counts on TCP connections
	IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, non-IP, and other packet and byte counts
	TCP/UDP counts by ports
	Packet counts by packet sizes
	Packet and byte counts by IP address
	Interface activity
	Flag statuses on TCP packets
	LAN station statistics

This program can be used to determine the type of traffic on your network,
and what kind of service is the most heavily used on what machines, among
others.

IPTraf-ng works on Ethernet, FDDI, PLIP, loopback, and SLIP/PPP
interfaces. Also supports GRE-over-IP tunnels, 802.1ad and QinQ VLAN,
and SIT tunnels.

Updates and announcements are at the iptraf-ng@lists.fedorahosted.org,
see README.contact for more information.

IMPORTANT CHANGES
-----------------

Important changes are detailed in the CHANGES file, please take some
time to read it.  There are some changes in the log file names, and
the policies on multiple instances have been somewhat relaxed.

DISTRIBUTION NOTICE
-------------------

This is the general release of IPTraf-ng.  IPTraf-ng has been incorporated into
the Fedora, RHEL-7.0, Centos-7.0, Ubuntu, Debian GNU/Linux, Turbolinux and S.u.S.E.
distributions, as well as the Trinux security toolkit distribution.

Linux distributions may have tailored the IPTraf-ng package to suit their
purposes.  Send direct questions, comments or inquiries about a
distribution-specific package to its maintainer.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

IPTraf-ng 1.1.x and later  requires at least Linux kernel 2.2.  It uses the new
PF_PACKET socket family as its capture mechanism.  This feature is new to
the 2.2 kernel.  Make sure you have the Packet Socket driver compiled in or
installed as a module, or IPTraf-ng will fail (and so will others like it:
tcpdump, netwatch, etc).

IPTraf-ng also requires glibc 2.1 or later.
